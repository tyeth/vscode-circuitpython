        .. warning:: This will change the system clock speed to match the DVI signal.
           Make sure to initialize other objects after this one so they account
           for the changed clock.

        This allocates a very large framebuffer and is most likely to succeed
        the earlier it is attempted.

        Each dp and dn pair of pins must be neighboring, such as 19 and 20.
        They must also be ordered the same way. In other words, dp must be
        less than dn for all pairs or dp must be greater than dn for all pairs.

        The framebuffer pixel format varies depending on color_depth:

        * 1 - Each bit is a pixel. Either white (1) or black (0).
        * 2 - Each 2 bits is a pixels. Grayscale between white (0x3) and black (0x0).
        * 8 - Each byte is a pixels in RGB332 format.
        * 16 - Each two bytes are a pixel in RGB565 format.

        Two output resolutions are currently supported, 640x480 and 800x480.
        Monochrome framebuffers (color_depth=1 or 2) must be full resolution.
        Color framebuffers must be half resolution (320x240 or 400x240) and
        pixels will be duplicated to create the signal.

        A Framebuffer is often used in conjunction with a
        `framebufferio.FramebufferDisplay`.

        :param int width: the width of the target display signal. Only 320, 400, 640 or 800 is currently supported depending on color_depth.
        :param int height: the height of the target display signal. Only 240 or 480 is currently supported depending on color_depth.
